## Group Agreement

### Conflict Plan

When differences in ideas arise, we will consider options based off of what we perceive to be the easiest solution.
If the solution is unsuccessful, we proceed to the next one. When escalating conflicts are unsuccessful, we make another 
solution until we obtain a correct one.

### Communication Plan

We will communicate with each other via Slack messages. To ensure everyone's voices are heard, we will ensure that 
everyone has a chance to give their idea before any implementation is done. To create a safe environemnt where it would 
help everyone feel comfortable speaking up, we will ask for opinions and encourage one another.
